Hi future visitors,
You are reading this when i am famous

Today on 7th Jan, I cried the hell out.
  The situation seemingly is not in my favor right now, but this willnot be prolonged extension to my mystery.
  Most of my batchmates got the internship, I have not grabbed one.
  For the past 3 years, due to family problems my brain was exhausted, now it improved a bit to look good mummy is down,
  only thing I want now is to prove her right.

  10 march was my Maths 10th boards, until then from today I will work the hardest of my calibre and got myself skilled and polished with confidence.

  On my way to get my internship and placement.
  Oh my friend Ganesha, dena sath hamesha
